# WSN-DDoS-Attack-H-IoT2023

This repository contains the dataset and preprocessing notebook used to develop the poster paper presented at **The 12th IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (IEEE ICHI 2024)**: 
[**"Time Series Anomaly Detection with CNN for Environmental Sensors in Healthcare-IoT" (IEEE 2024)**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10628718)

The dataset captures **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployed within a Healthcare-IoT (H-IoT) environment. It is generated using the **Cooja IoT network simulator**, with environmental sensors primarily monitoring **room temperature and humidity**. A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model is trained on this dataset and achieves an accuracy of **92%**.

## üìä Dataset Summary
```
- **Shape**: (11191 rows, 6 columns)
- **Features Used for Model Training**:
  - `id` ‚Äî unique message index
  - `interval` ‚Äî time difference (in milliseconds) between the current and previous message from the same node
  - `previous_send_intervals_same_node` ‚Äî list of previous intervals for the same node
  - `average_previous_send_intervals_same_node` ‚Äî mean interval over previous sends
  - `previous_sender` ‚Äî node ID that sends the previous message
  - `malicious` ‚Äî class label (`1` for malicious, `0` for normal)
```
> These features are derived from the Cooja simulation raw sensor log and are used to train the CNN-based anomaly detection model.
